# MIPS-Processor
The aim of this project is to design a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor for RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor. 
The MIPS processor was designed using MIPS ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and divided into two parts:  the datapath unit, and the control unit. 
Verilog HDL language to design hardware modeling is used on Altera ModelSim tool.  
Then, it was tested to run Fibonacci number program and finally we saw the RTL Viewer of the MIPS Processor in Quartus .

The project consists of :
1-Datapath
2-Instruction Memory
3-Data Memory
4-Control Unit

we wrote thr RTL code of sub modules and then we integrate it in Top Module
